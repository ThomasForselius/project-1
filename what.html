            <h2 class="head" id="history">History</h2>
                Thomas, the creator of FriendFeud, is studying webdesign and wanted a real life project for his design course, and this game was the product. 
                <br><br>The basis for this game was a drunken brainstorm between friends that may have started small and soon got out of hand - as many ideas do when alcohol is induced.<br> In this case, it was a good thing!
