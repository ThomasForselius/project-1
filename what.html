            <h2 class="head">The idea</h2>
                <p>
                    FriendFeud is a set of real life games and events with the purpose of bringing people together.
                    <br><br>
                    This webpage is the digital hub that connects those people and the results of the games, as well as show a road map of what events are in the pipeline.
                </p>
                
        
            <h2 class="head" id="history">History</h2>
                <p>
                    Thomas, the creator of FriendFeud, is studying webdesign and wanted a real life project for his design course, and this game was the product. 
                    <br><br>The basis for this game was a drunken brainstorm between friends that may have started small and soon got out of hand - as many ideas do when alcohol is induced.<br> In this case, it was a good thing! 
                </p>

            <h2 class="head" id="rules">Rules</h2>
                <p>
                    Here there will be a set of rules and codes of conduct regarding the game, but as the game is still in developement this section is yet to be filled out.
